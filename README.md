# Welcome to SVG Animation
It is simple SVG animation, I have used animation and transition to apply animated effects on the page.

## Tech stack:
- HTML
- CSS

## How it is done?
- The SVG image for animation is downloaded from [undraw.co](https://undraw.co/illustrations) website. Following is the downloaded image.

- Using [figma.com](https://www.figma.com/), modified the downloaded SVG image as per my preference. Following you can see exported image from Figma.
